This gif shows a simulation of an incompressible fluid in a thermally insulated 2D box, with a heat source near the bottom in the center.
The fluid is subject to a uniform - downwards - gravitational field, and convection forces due to gradients in the heat distribution function

The flow velocity is indicated by the quiver plot, with the arrow length roughly showing the flow speed at each point
The heat distribution is indicated by the colourmap, where violet/blue corresponds to a low heat density, and green/yellow corresponds to a high heat density

The fluid is initially at rest, with a uniform inital heat distribution.
